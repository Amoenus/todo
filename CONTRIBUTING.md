The project has simple use cases and the implementation is guided by the Clean Architecture book. Please get used to the code base by:

* Checkout the code. 
* Running tests. 
* Switching the delivery mechanism between Web API and the Console App.
* Switching the persistence layer between In Memory and SQL Server.

We lack on good topics on `Readme.md` please review and add new content. It will be nice if we have new `Unit Tests` and `Acceptance Tests`.
